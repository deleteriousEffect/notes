Property-based testing: it generates a bunch of test cases based on the inputs on your functions. Instead of an example
or two, probably find lots of gross bugs with this. Way easier than doing a table-driven tests, at least more compact.

Every bug in production passed all the tests, typechecks, and linters. The simpler a program is the less painful
debugging will be.

Mutable variables conflate value and time.
